# chainsnap



[chainsnap.io](https://chainsnap.io) is an initiative launched by [Storj](https://www.storj.io) and [ANKR](https://www.ankr.com) to help blockchain projects and the broader technology community have access to varrious point-in-time snapshots of network chainstate.  Data is hosted on the Storj network and made globally available with massive transfer parallelism with the Storj uplink protocol.  



While incubated by the teams at Storj and ANKR, all projects and participants are welcome to supply data to the service and in-fact we encourage a varriety of networks, clients, node-types and snapshot ages to be contirbuted.  



Aside from being a public good, an important motivation for this effort is to highlight that having decentralized networks - and measuring resiliancy with metrics like the Nakamoto Coefficient - are insufficent.  In reality the speed to getting an accurate state representation, along with making it consumable by applications, is much more important to the health and longevity of a protocol.



## Contents

This repo will contain general documentation and lightweight specs to advertise and publish your network/protocol snapshots.  The specifications have been developed to provide brief, consistent metadata about the paylods to allow the entire process to be automated, once onboarded.
